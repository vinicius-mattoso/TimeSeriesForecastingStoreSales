## Introduction

Time series forecasting involves predicting future values based on past observations and is widely used in various fields, including finance, economics, and sales forecasting. This repository aims to provide a collection of tutorials, articles, code examples, and other relevant materials to help learners understand the fundamentals and practical applications of time series forecasting techniques.

## Getting Started

If you're new to time series forecasting, you might want to start with the following resources:

- [Time Series Forecasting: Core Concepts and Definitions](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-27852-5_5): This chapter will present the main definitions and concepts for time series forecasting. It begins by introducing time series before leading into the general form and definitions of a time series forecast.



## Resources

This section contains a curated list of resources that cover various aspects of time series forecasting, including algorithms, tools, and case studies:
